JAX-RS: Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS) is a Java programming language API specification
that provides support in creating web services according to the Representational State Transfer
(REST) architectural pattern. JAX-RS uses annotations, introduced in Java SE 5, to simplify the
development and deployment of web service clients and endpoints.

open source framework for developing RESTful Web Services in Java. It provides support for JAX-RS
APIs and serves as a JAX-RS (JSR 311 & JSR 339) Reference Implementation. But, it is also more than
the Reference Implementation. Jersey provides an API so that developers may extend Jersey to suit
their needs.
